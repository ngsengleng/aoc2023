Solutions written without guidance for Advent of Code 2023. This is my first time using C++ as a language so for the first few days the code structure and file structure might look abit funky but I swear I'm learning as I go along. I am also not very used to the whole OOP paradigm so some of the code might look a bit awkward.

I try my best to conform to good code quality (to the best of my ability, pretend you don't see blatant usage of magic strings or numbers)
